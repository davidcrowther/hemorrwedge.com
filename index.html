        <h3>Imagine Being Able To Sit Without Pain <br> Again - Even If You’ve Suffered From <br> Hemorrhoids For Years</h3>
        <p>Hemorrhoids don't make for polite ‘dinner table’ conversation - which is probably why nobody talks about this very common ailment.</p>
        <p>Medical professionals tell us that millions of cases of Hemorrhoids occur every year. And although the numbers keep growing as the population ages, they occur across every age group.</p>
        <p><strong>In short, you’re not suffering alone.</strong></p>
        <p>So, with so much of the population suffering from this common condition, you would think that conventional  wisdom should have been able to come up with a better solution to ending Hemorrhoid pain besides messy creams and ointments.</p>
        <p>Or worse, pricey invasive procedures with painful recovery times that can be even worse than the Hemorrhoids themselves.</p>
    </div>
</section>

<section class="until-now">
    <div class="container">
        <h4>Until now, your options for treating your hemorrhoids have consisted of:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Over-the-counter and prescription topical ointments and creams</li>
            <li>Sitting in a sitz bath several times a day</li>
            <li>Icing several times a day</li>
            <li>Rubber band ligation</li>
            <li>Cauterization</li>
            <li>Freezing</li>
            <li>Sclerotherapy</li>
            <li>Stapled Hemorrhoidopexy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let’s assume that you want to avoid painful surgery and the other methods on that list that involve a
            physician going anywhere near your sensitive areas with rubber bands or staples. In that case, what you have
            left are over-the-counter ointments and creams, sitz baths, and ice.</p>
        <p>All perfectly adequate ways of dealing with the symptoms.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, sitting in a sitz bath or on top of a lumpy, melting bag of ice several times a day is not
            exactly convenient for people who lead active lives and have jobs.</p>
        <p>Which is really a shame, because icing has been found to be one of the most effective ways of dealing with
            the short term swelling and inflammation of Hemorrhoids while also being incredibly successful at the long
            term shrinking of the Hemorrhoids themselves.</p>
        <p class="footer">One method we’ve discovered that gives you all of the benefits of icing without any of the drawbacks (having to sit on hard, lumpy bags of ice that melt and leak several times a day) is the
            <strong>Hemorrwedge</strong>.</p>
    </div>

<section class="exactly-it">
    <div class="container">
        <h3>What exactly is it?</h3>
        <h5>It’s a small, blue silicone gel ice pack that is perfectly shaped so it can be <br> applied directly to the inflamed area - but it’s not ice so it will never leak or leave
            <br> a wet mark behind on your pants or your chair.</h5>
        <img src="img/img-1.png" alt="" class="img-responsive">
        <p>One of the things we are really loving about this gorgeous little blue gem is that it’s completely discreet.
            No one ever has to know you’re using it.</p>
        <p class="footer">What we’re seeing is that since the Hemorrwedge is able to be applied directly to the affected area, the
            benefits of the icing are maximized.</p>
        <p>Most find that with each cooling session there is a noticeable reduction in the swelling and inflammation
            and within a few days the Hemorrhoids are often completely gone.</p>
        <p>Even the best creams and ointments can’t manage that.</p>
        <p><strong>And perhaps best of all, it’s comfortable to use.</strong></p>
        <p>If sitting atop a bag of hard, lumpy ice while it melts all over your sofa doesn’t sound appealing, you'll appreciate the comfortable shape of the silicone gel pack. It’s the best option we’ve found and there's nothing else on the market like it.</p>

        <h3>What others are saying about <br> Hemorrwedge</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <span class="quot">“</span>
            <cite>I’ve suffered from haemorrhoids a few times and they usually go away after a week or so using creams
                and suppositories. Just recently though I had the mother of all haemorrhoids, it just didn’t want to
                disappear. It was so bad I started looking at surgery but the stories I read online of the pain after
                surgery put me off that straight away.</cite>
            <cite>I tried using ice cubes in a bag. It wasn’t a pleasant experience but it was effective. The ice cubes
                were lumpy and hard and leak everywhere.</cite>
            <cite>Eventually I found the hemorrwedge and it was such a relief, quite literally. It’s so simple to use,
                comfortable and can use it over and over again. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who suffers
                from haemorrhoids.</cite>

        <h3>What it comes with...</h3>
        <p class="bigger">RIGHT OUT OF THE PACKAGE, YOU'LL BE AMAZED. <br>
            The Hemorrwedge comes two to a pack, in an attractive hygienic plastic case <br> with a lid, so you can feel confident keeping it in your freezer. </p>
        <ul class="list clearfix">
            <li><img src="img/img-2.png" alt="" class="img-responsive"></li>
            <li><img src="img/img-3.png" alt="" class="img-responsive"></li>
            <li><img src="img/img-4.png" alt="" class="img-responsive"></li>
        </ul>
        <p>They’re incredibly easy to keep clean - just a quick wash with warm, soapy water after every use <br> and they’re
            ready to go back in the case and into the freezer.</p>
        <p>You'll immediately see why they are so effective. The unique shape combined with the soft, <br> flexible gel that
            firms up when frozen creates a far more pleasant user experience over plain ice <br> cubes.</p>
